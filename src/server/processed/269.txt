Sherlock doesnt like much burden at once and therefore he will not carry more than two clues at any time.

Sherlock covers the distance between any two points in the time\requal to the square of the euclidean distance between the points. Also, Sherlock is initially at the same position as his clue box.\rNow being a brilliant programmer, you want to help Sherlock.
