This news is not public. \rIf they fire people officially/publically, they have to give employee four month salary and hundred person bonus. And firing will create bad image in industry. \rWhat they did is, they targeted set of employee and started documenting negative comment about those employee. Comment like: you should have design this; your code should not have any error, Your are lacking in xyz skill. They humiliated targeted employees so that employee resigns. If an employee resign, he or she can not file a case against Microsoft. They used this dirty technique to avoid legal issue in future.\rOnce they are done with documentation, HR asked targeted person to leave the company with \u201cTermination letter\u201d on same day since he/she hadn\u2019t performed well. HR also gave option to targeted employee to resign and sit home for 45. Fear of having termination letter and losing job immediately, everyone took 2nd option to resign. This is bad. \rThis can not happen in USA. USA has very strong labor law and people respect each other.\rBefore you join Microsoft in India, think again.
