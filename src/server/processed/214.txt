While watching the television, one day he decided to play a small game, where\rhe has to identify the minimum number of clicks required to surf a given set of channels in a\rsequence. He quickly decided that it makes for an interesting problem to solve using a software\rprogram, (oh, forgot to tell you that he likes to code when he is not busy with his school work).\rYour task is to write the software program (using any of the programming language choices\rgiven), before Gaurav can do it himself, we think he is going to take 2 hours, so you think you\rcan beat the 12 year old in solving this, we think so! Your time starts now!\rObviously the program has to take the following instructions and constraints into account.\rInstructions\rThere are 13 buttons on his remote: 10 buttons for the numbers (0-9), an \"Up Channel\" button,\ra \"Down Channel\" button, and a \"Back\" button:\r\u25cf The number buttons allow you to jump directly to a specific channel.

(Ex: If channel 1 is viewed, then channel 100, then when Back is pressed, the\rtelevision will go to channel 1.)\rGaurav can get from one channel to the next in one of the two ways:\r\u25cf Clicking any combination of \"Up Channel\", \"Down Channel\", and \"Back\" buttons.\r\u25cf Keying in the numbers to the channel.
