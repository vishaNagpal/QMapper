For example, if our secret word was \"abcxy@hoho.com\", we would generate:\r ab abcx abcxy@ abcxy@ho ... ...... abcxy@hoho.com\r Then, for every prefix s, following hash H is computed: md5(md5(e) + s + md5(s)) [where + is the string concatenation operator and e is \"xxxxx@hehu.xxx.edu\"].\r Finally, all hash strings H are concatenated to form the long hash above....\r For example, for abcxy@hoho.com, - the hash would be computed as\r md5(md5('xxxxx@hehu.xxx.edu') + 'ab' + md5('ab')) +\rmd5(md5('xxxxx@hehu.xxx.edu') + 'abcx' + md5('abcx')) +\rmd5(md5('xxxxx@hehu.xxx.edu') + 'abcxy@' + md5('abcxy@')) +\r...\rFor the sake of simplicity, you can assume that secret word only contains alphanumeric characters and these 4 characters: _ . @ +\r and using e= xxxxx@hehu.xxx.edu, the hash is generated.\r and we have to find out that secret word (from the hash).\r These are the details I have researched:\r Hash from MD5 is always 128 bits/16 bytes/32 ascii characters long\rCollision Attack\rBirthday Attack\rAny Hidden paterns in the given hash\rI am looking for a direction here.
