Cells number i and i+1 are adjacent, and prisoners in adjacent cells are called \"neighbors.\" A wall with a window separates adjacent cells, and neighbors can communicate through that window.\rAll prisoners live in peace until a prisoner is released. When that happens, the released prisoner's neighbors find out, and each communicates this to his other neighbor. That prisoner passes it on to his other neighbor, and so on until they reach a prisoner with no other neighbor (because he is in cell 1, or in cell P, or the other adjacent cell is empty). A prisoner who discovers that another prisoner has been released will angrily break everything in his cell, unless he is bribed with a gold coin. So, after releasing a prisoner in cell A, all prisoners housed on either side of cell A - until cell 1, cell P or an empty cell - need to be bribed.\rAssume that each prison cell is initially occupied by exactly one prisoner, and that only one prisoner can be released per day. Given the list of Q prisoners to be released in Q days, find the minimum total number of gold coins needed as bribes if the prisoners may be released in any order.\rNote that each bribe only has an effect for one day. If a prisoner who was bribed yesterday hears about another released prisoner today, then he needs to be bribed again.\r Task: find the minimum amount of gold we need to bribe the prisoners so that the chosen prisoners can be released without causing cell destruction.\rInput example:\r8 cells, 1 prisoner has to be released.
