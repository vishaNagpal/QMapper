{"i": "121665", "t": "Oil excavation is a common phenomenon in the sea. At every excavation site a rig is setup to extract the oil. The only mode to reach a rig is by a boat. Men who would like to reach a rig use special purpose boats which can run on crude fuel available at the rigs and the shore. These boats can run a mile for every unit of fuel they consume. Each man on the boat consumes a unit of food for every mile he travels. Boats have a limited load capacity. The net weight, including the weight of fuel, food and the men, on boat should never exceed its load capacity. The weight of one unit of fuel is same as the weight of one unit of food. However, as the rigs are far from the shore in the sea it is usually a very long sail. The capacity of the boat available for fuel may not be sufficient to reach the destination rig directly. In such cases, the men may goto a near by rig to load required fuel. The men can also store food at the rigs as well as at the shore for later consumption. They must buy all the food they require to reach the destination rig at the shore only. And all the men who started should be together throughout the sail.\r You should now write a program which can help these men decide the minimum amount of food they require to reach the destination rig. The positions of rigs and the boat's starting point are indicated as co-ordinates of a two dimensional plane with x and y axises of 1 mile units. Food at shore is available only in whole units.\r Assume that the food and fuel are consumed continuously, that is if you travel a partial mile the number of units of food and fuel consumed is equal to portion of mile traveled.\r Input\r The first line of input has a list of integers terminated by -1. The first integer is the capacity of the boat. The integers following it up to -1 are the weights of men who need to reach the destination rig.\r Lines following will have two integers separated by a space, each line indicating the x and y coordinates of a coordinate pair respectively. The input will be terminated by a coordinate pair (0,0) and this should not be processed. The first co-ordinate pair indicates the position of the boat's starting point. The last coordinate pair indicates the position of the destination rigs. All other points indicate the position of various rigs in the sea in a random order.\r Output\r Your program should print the minimum amount of food required to reach the destination. If it is not possible to reach destination, then the program should print -1.\r Samples\rSample Input 1:\r250 20 30 -1\r10 -20\r-10 5\r30 15\r15 35\r0 0\r Output 1:\r111 \t\r  Sample Input 2:\r300 15 20 30 -1\r10 -20\r-10 5\r30 15\r-30 45\r0 0\r Output 2:\r807 \t\r  Sample Input 3:\r150 20 30 -1\r1 1\r100 100\r0 0\r Output 3:\r-1", "k": ["food", "rig", "destination rig", "reach", "boat"]}
{"i": "121664", "t": "One of the cherished customs of my childhood was choosing up sides for a cricket game. We did it this way: The two bullies of our gully would appoint themselves captains of the opposing teams, and then they would take turns picking other players. On each round, a captain would choose the most capable (or, towards the end, the least inept) player from the pool of remaining candidates, until everyone present had been assigned to one side or the other. The aim of this ritual was to produce two evenly matched teams and, along the way, to remind each of us of our precise ranking in the neighbourhood pecking order.\r We all believed this was the fairest process, but does it ensure the fairest selection of players with evenly matched teams? We believed so, but then there were times when, as the game progressed we realized that the other team was stronger than ours and may be an exchange of a couple of players between the teams would have made them balanced. That scope of improvement seemed to be there...\r Here, we need to find a way to create two evenly balanced teams for any game(or as evenly balanced as possible considering the strength of each player). A set of players must be divided into two teams. Each player must be on one team or the other; the number of player on the two teams must not differ by more than 1; each player will have a skill-point associated with him. The total skill-points of the players on each team should be as nearly equal as possible.(The absolute difference of the sum of skill-points of players in each team should be the least).\r Input:\r The first line of input shall contain N, the total number of players. N lines will follow with the first line giving the skill-point of person 1; the second line, the skill-point of person 2; and so on. Each skill-point shall be an integer between 1 and 450. There shall be at most 100 players in all.\r Output:\r Your output should be a single line containing 2 numbers: the total skill-points of the players on one team, and the total skill-points of the players on the other team. Print the smaller sum first.\r Sample Input 1:\r3\r90\r200\r100\r Output 1:\r190 200 \t\r Sample Input 2:\r10\r2\r3\r10\r5\r8\r9\r7\r3\r5\r2\r Output 2:\r27 27 \t\r Sample Input 3:\r10\r1\r1\r1\r1\r1\r1\r1\r1\r1\r9\r Output 3:\r5 13 \t\r  Sample Input 4:\r8\r87\r100\r28\r67\r68\r41\r67\r1\r Output 4:\r229 230", "k": ["players", "sample input", "teams", "input", "player"]}
