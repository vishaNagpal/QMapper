The price per\runit of every item is highly variable, depending on the supplier, the\rnumber ordered, and the client/buyer who places the order. With her\ryears of record-keeping, Julia knows the best unit price she can get for\rany item in any of a limited number of order sizes. Some items cost less\rper unit when the number ordered goes up, some cost less per unit\rwhen the number ordered goes down, and others have no rhyme or\rreason for the unit prices available.\rTo price a new event, Julia consults her database of past offers.\rIf the amount needed for the new event is exactly the same as the\ramount in a past offer, the unit price is also the same.\rIf she has a price for a higher amount and a price for a smaller\ramount, her best guess will be that the unit cost will be linearly\rinterpolated from the unit costs for the closest lower amount and\rthe closest higher amount.\rIf the database only has one amount, then her best guess is that this\rwill be her unit cost.\rAnd, if the amounts for which she has offers are all smaller or all\rlarger than the amount she needs, then she finds it most accurate to\rlinearly extrapolate from the closest two points to the amount\rneeded.\rFinally, sometimes price offers lapse. When this happens, Julia, who\ris not very database savvy, just overwrites the old unit price with a\rzero or negative number. The amounts associated with zero or\rnegative unit price need to be disregarded.\rautomated so she can do it for hundreds of items with thousands of\rindividual prices.\rComplete the function extrapolate , which takes a new amount n, an\rarray amount of old offer amounts in increasing order, and an array\rucost of corresponding unit prices.
