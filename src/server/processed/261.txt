Thus -21, -30, 0, 5, 14 etc are Walprimes, while -121, 1, 143 etc. are not Walprimes.\rNow, consider a n-digit integer d1d2d3..dn. Between any 2 consecutive digits you can place either a (+) sign, a (-) sign or nothing. So, there are 3n-1 different expressions that can be formed from it. Some of the expressions so formed may evaluate to a Walprime. For example, consider the 6 digit integer 123456: 1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236, which is a Walprime, but 123 + 4 - 56 = 71, which is not a Walprime.\rYour task is to write a program to find the no. of expressions (out of the possible 3n-1 expressions) that evaluate to a Walprime, for a given input. Note that leading zeroes are valid. For example, if the input is 1202004, it can be split as 12 + 020 - 04 etc. Also, the input itself can contain leading zeroes.\rInput format: (Read from stdin)\rThe first line of input contains a single integer 'T' denoting the no. of test cases.\rEach of the following 'T' lines contain a single string 's' (of length 'n') denoting an input for which you need to find the no. of valid expressions evaluating to a Walprime.\rOutput format: (Write to stdout)\rOutput exactly 'T' integers (one per line), where the ith line denotes the no. of valid expressions that evaluate to a Walprime for the ith input string. Since the output can be large, print all the quantities modulo 1000000007.\rSample testcase:\rInput:\r2\r011\r12345\rOutput:\r6\r64\rExplanation:\rFor the first test case, s = \"011\".

Out of these 9 expressions, only the following 6 of them evaluate to a Walprime: {0+1+1, 0+1-1, 0-1+1, 0-1-1, 01+1, 01-1}.\rConstraints:\rThere are 3 data sets.\rFor the first data set (5 points) -\r1\rFor the second data set (10 points) -\r1\rFor the third data set (15 points) -\r1", "k": ["engineers at google", "google have decided", "walprime", "expressions", "input"]}
