There is data for ~300k pins and ~10k boards, with possible duplicates.\r Each board JSON dict contains the fields id, user_id, username, name, slug, description, and category (which may be null, but if not, is one of a fixed set of categories). Each pin JSON dict contains the fields id, board_id, user_id, img_url, is_repin, is_video, source, and link.\r To get the data into a format that is easy to work with, consider using a lightweight database system like SQLite.", "k": ["write a function", "returns a list", "write", "data", "related"]}
