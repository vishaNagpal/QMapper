Each CD have multiple tracks.  \r Implement a shuffle function that play all tracks on all CDs randomly. The requirement is a track cannot be play twice unless all songs have been played once. \r I initially proposed to pre-process all CDs to know how many songs are there in total, then pick them randomly. But the interviewer told me that preprocessing may take several minutes, which is not acceptable. He expects a waiting time in seconds between each song. I was stuck in how to implement such randomness given the delay constraint..."}
