Each minute that a student is on your bus, that student drinks one ounce of soda. Your goal is to drop the students off quickly, so that the total amount of soda consumed by all students is as small as possible.You know how many students will get off of the bus at each exit. Your bus begins somewhere along the highway (probably not at either end) and moves at a constant speed of 37.4 miles per hour. You must drive the bus along the highway; however, you may drive forward to one exit then backward to an exit in the opposite direction, switching as often as you like. (You can stop the bus, drop off students, and turn around instantaneously.)Describe an efficient algorithm to drop the students off so that they drink as little soda as possible. Your input consists of the bus route (a list of the exits, together with the travel time between successive exits), the number of students you will drop off at each exit, and the current location of your bus (which you may assume is an exit). How would you approach this problem"}
