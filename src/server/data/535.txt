To help you memorize\rthe number, you want to divide it into groups of contiguous digits. Each group must contain\rexactly 2 or 3 digits. There are three kinds of groups:\r\u2022 Excellent: A group that contains only the same digits. For example, 000 or 77.\r\u2022 Good: A group of 3 digits, 2 of which are the same. For example, 030, 229 or 166.\r\u2022 Usual: A group in which all the digits are distinct. For example, 123 or 90.\rThe quality of a group assignment is defined as\r2 \u00d7 (number of excellent groups) + (number of good groups)\rDivide the number into groups such that the quality is maximized.
