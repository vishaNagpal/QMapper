{"i": "8272868", "t": "For SDE Interns...On-site Interview #4\r Assume that you have 2^32 bytes of memory. When a program asks to allocate memory, a 4kb chunk of memory gets allocated. It can be allocated at any position (e.g. 0, 57, 8192). Now assume we have a function called lookup(), which, when fed an arbitrary address, (1) returns the value of the starting address of the chunk encompassing the requested address if it was allocated, or (2) returns a value indicating false if no block was allocated. Lookup must work IN CONSTANT TIME. To help clarify the functionality, here is some example expected behavior:Allocate(1) /* allocates bytes 1-4096 */\r\nAllocate(4099) /* allocates bytes 4099-8194 */\r\nLookup(123) /* returns 1 */\r\nLookup(4096) /* returns 1 */\r\nLookup(4098) /* returns -1 or false */\r\nLookup(6042) /* returns 4099 */\r\nLookup(8198) /* returns -1 or false */To the readers, my solution had 2 checks maximum (and thus was O(1)).

In the event that one call ends as soon as another starts, answer part 2 of this question in such a way as to maximize revenue).\r What information should the satellite store for each phone call? Define a data structure for this (e.g. write a struct).\r Write a function that finds the maximum number of simultaneous phone calls from a given customer.
