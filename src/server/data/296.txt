{"i": "17543678", "t": "Q: If you have all the companies that are traded, and live inputs are coming of which company is being traded and what is the volume, how do you maintain the data, so that you can carry out operation of giving the top 10 most traded companies by volume of shares most efficiently.\rA: I juggled between Hash Map and Max Heap. I said Max Heap, since I can take out top 10 companies in a jiffy with a Max Heap. But then he asked you will need to find a company everytime there is a trade, which will take quite some time in Heap. He pointed out that in real world scenario, number of trades happening, and hence searching of the company and updating it, will be many times more than finding top 10. Which bought me to HashMap. Updations can happen in Real time, while finding top 10 can be done in O(n) or O(nlog(n)) time.\rEven that wasn't optimal obviously. The interviewer was very nice and friendly type guy. He stressed that at every trade, at most, only 1 company will change in my top 10. This hit me and got me to the correct answer that we keep all actual data in HashMap, but also maintain a MinHeap of 10 most traded company."}

But since output has to be in alphabetic order, we will use a Trie DS, where at the end of each word, we simple store a list of page numbers."}

{"i": "17544673", "t": "Q: Do you know what is a Binary tree? How would you go about coding for addition of a new element to Binary tree?\rA: I asked if they want a Binary Tree or a BST? When he said BST I just said we can have a recursive function in which we pass the root of the tree and see if the value to be added is smaller or bigger than the root, and depending on result, we go to left or right of the tree, assuming the left (or right) is not null. If null, just use new to create a memory location, put the value, and use the left reference of the root to link to this new memory.\tSimple basic stuff."}

You just maintain a new stack of minimum number till that point."}
