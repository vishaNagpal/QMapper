Write pseudocode that returns (to stdout) a subset of strings in (1) that contain the same distinct characters (regardless of order) as input in (2). Optimize for time.\r4. Assume that this function will need to be invoked repeatedly. Initializing the string array once and storing in memory is okay . Please avoid solutions that require looping through all 10000 strings.\r For example, if you have strings in (1): mary, brad, pitt, yygr\rand the user types in: ry --> the output should be \"mary\" and \"yygr\"\ror if the user types in: dd --> brad"}
