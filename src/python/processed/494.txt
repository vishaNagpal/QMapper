No linked list, data structure related questions from C, opposed to many feedback in careercup and in other sites. Most questions were around my past experience, some basic embedded questions and bit manipulations. I was disappointed as all preparation went in vain - especially a simple matrix question i was asked, wasn't able to answer correctly, which was a disaster after I knew the answer. Some interviewers probably were taking interview for first time. One kept checking emails while I was answering questions and somebody kept knocking the door (for fun) all throughout the interview. He told me just ignore that :) . The interview was for general positions, 'anything that's matches my credential'. I am supposed to get an answer in 1 week, it's been two weeks I haven't heard back. I think the matrix question from the director ruined my chance. But there were 7 interviewers. One told me and I realized in the beginning it wasn't a match in his group.
