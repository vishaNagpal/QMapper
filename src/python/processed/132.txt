This makes the number easier to remember for customers. An example may\rbe 1-800-FLOWERS\rThis coding challenge is to write a program that will show a user possible matches for a list\rof provided phone numbers.\rYour program should be a command line application that reads from files specified as\rcommand-line arguments or STDIN when no files are given. Each line of these files will\rcontain a single phone number.\rFor each phone number read, your program should output all possible word replacements\rfrom a dictionary. Your program should try to replace every digit of the provided phone\rnumber with a letter from a dictionary word; however, if no match can be made, a single\rdigit can be left as is at that point. No two consecutive digits can remain unchanged and\rthe program should skip over a number (producing no output) if a match cannot be made.\rYour program should allow the user to set a dictionary with the -d command-line option,\rbut it's fine to use a reasonable default for your system. The dictionary is expected to have\rone word per line.\rAll punctuation and whitespace should be ignored in both phone numbers and the\rdictionary file. The program should not be case sensitive, letting \"a\" == \"A\". Output should\rbe capital letters and digits separated at word boundaries with a single dash (-), one\rpossible word encoding per line.

{"i": "5747468982550528", "t": "Vehicle Survey Code Challenge\rA small city government recently bought a vehicle counter. In order for the vehicle counter\rto work, pneumatic rubber hoses are stretched across the road. Data is produced by the\rvehicle counter as traffic drives across the hoses. The city government requires a program\rto interpret the data that the machine produces.\rThe data from the machine looks like this:\r! A268981\r! A269123\r! A604957\r! B604960\r! A605128\r! B605132\r! A1089807\r! B1089810\r! A1089948\r! B1089951\rThe numbers are the number of milliseconds since midnight when the mark occurred.\rThus, the first line above represents a pair of tires driving by at 12:04:28am. The second\rline represents another pair of tires going by 142ms later (almost certainly the 2nd axle of\rthe car).\rThe vehicle counter has two pneumatic rubber hoses - one stretches across both lanes of\rtraffic, and one goes just across traffic in one direction. Each hose independently records\rwhen tires drive over it. As such, cars going in one direction (say, northbound) only record\ron one sensor (preceded with an 'A'), while cars going in the direction (say, southbound)\rare recorded on both sensors. Lines 3-6 above represent a second car going in the other\rdirection. The first set of tires hit the 'A' sensor at 12:10:04am, and then hit the 'B' sensor\r3ms later. The second set of tires then hit the 'A' sensor 171ms later, and then the 'B'\rsensor 4ms later.\rThe machine was left to run for 5 days in a row (starting on a Monday). This is obvious\rbecause the times in the data make several sudden drops:\r! A86328771\r! B86328774\r! A86328899\r! B86328902\r! A582668\r! B582671\r! A582787\r!
