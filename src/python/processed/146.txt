Now Using hashTable just store existing 1000bits-length pattern and all their sequence numbers. And, then transfer this hashTable to server. So for example datastore consists of \"file1, file2, file3=file1+file2\" then we can reduce network data by 50%\r So interviewer asked why 1000bits and why not 100bits or 10000bits. Also, as we increase length of bit-pattern, probability of getting duplicate patterns reduces and if we decrease length of pattern we may not be able to effectively reduce network data transferred\r Solution-4: Don't divided storage bits into equal length pattern but in variable length pattern so client tells server \"Pattern-X(bit string) of length L exists at offsets 5, 10003, 363738, 42311, 43433.\r Interviewer said how can check for variable length patterns on client machine as this will be computaionally inefficient. I suggested Trie, Huffman coding, file-by-file comparison but he straightway discarded those ideas :)\r He gave final important hint that \r\tsomehow client should give indication to server that next bytes are going to be like this without tranferring those bytes and \r\tthen server should tell client that \"OK don't send next 1000bits as I already have them from previously send/stored data at different section(like different file) in storage\"\r\tand asked me how to do it and how will be the handshake/protocol between server-client\r Since, throughout interview I was stuck to my hashTable solution and not able to think beyond hashTable, as per HR I got negative feedback in this interview :(\r Overall interviewer was helping lot and was really helpful.
