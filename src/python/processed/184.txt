On average while your system is running, there will be about 15 queues with an average of 80 or so bytes in each queue.

Your functions may be asked to create a smaller number of queues with more bytes in each.\rExecution speed is important. Worst-case performance when adding and removing bytes is more important than average-case performance.\r If you are unable to satisfy a request due to lack of memory, your code should call a provided failure function, which will not return:\r void on_out_of_memory(); \r If the caller makes an illegal request, like attempting to dequeue a byte from an empty queue, your code should call a provided failure function, which will not return:\r  void on_illegal_operation(); \rThere may be spikes in the number of queues allocated, or in the size of an individual queue.
