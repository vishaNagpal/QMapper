By two loops 100+99+98+97+...+1 = 100*101/2 (i.e. n*(n+1)/2)\rThen 2's complement, which is the most relevant representation of signed binary numbers. \rOdd numbers:\r+3: 0000 0011 -3: 1111 1101 Binary & is 0000 0001. \rFor all even numbers:\r+4: 0000 0100 and -4: 1111 1011+0000 0001 = 1111 1100 and Bitwise & of 4 and -4 is 0000 0100 which is 4.\rSo, in the innermost loop ans is incremented by 1 when i is odd and j is also odd. ie. when i is 1, 3, 5, 7... 97 and j is 3, 5, 7, 9,...,99 ans is added 1(return value of true ==) when calculated it comes to 1610.", "k": ["ghci bangalore", "experienced software developers", "asked at ghci", "int", "software developers"]}
