In each episode, the cats and dogs get to show themselves off, after which the viewers vote on which pets should stay and which should be forced to leave the show.\rEach viewer gets to cast a vote on two things: one pet which should be kept on the show, and one pet which should be thrown out. Also, based on the universal fact that everyone is either a cat lover (i.e. a dog hater) or a dog lover (i.e. a cat hater), it has been decided that each vote must name exactly one cat and exactly one dog.\rIngenious as they are, the producers have decided to use an advancement procedure which guarantees that as many viewers as possible will continue watching the show: the pets that get to stay will be chosen so as to maximize the number of viewers who get both their opinions satisfied. Write a program to calculate this maximum number of viewers.\r  Input\r On the first line one positive number: the number of testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:\rOne line with three integers c, d, v (1 \u2264 c, d \u2264 100 and 0 \u2264 v \u2264 500): the number of cats, dogs, and voters.\r v lines with two pet identifiers each. The first is the pet that this voter wants to keep, the second is the pet that this voter wants to throw out.
