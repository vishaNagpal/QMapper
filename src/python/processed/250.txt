Also, ensure that it takes as little memory as possible.\r Write a caching class EntityTagCache that is supposed to cache tags for a given\rid. Also provide TestEntityTagCache JUnit class that we can use to verify the\rfunctionality. We only need above two files ( e.g. no need for build file ), as\rwe'll go through your solution in an Eclipse Java project.\r An entity and its tags have following characteristics:\r - A given entity is identified by an int id. The id is >= 0.\r- An entity can have 0-N tags, where each tag is a string value. E.g. for\rid '1', we can have tags like 'foo' & 'bar'. There are around 1000 unique\rtags in 100 million entities, but the actual number can vary by a few thousand.\r- The EntityTagCache does not need to consider id/tag eviction.  It is expected\rfor the cache to throw a OutOfMemoryError if more tags exist than we can cache\rin memory.  However, the design should ensure that it takes as little memory \ras possible to cache the tags.\r- There can be maximum of 100 million entities in the cache and the id value\rcannot be more than the number of entities in the cache and is >= 0. Thus,\rif we've to cache 100 entities, then id is from 0 to 99.\r- We should be able to load our initial data into the cache when we create\rEntityTagCache.

Also, it\rdoes not need to have any notion of eviction, as we require that all the\rdata must be loaded in memory.  The cache only provides the following \rpublic method:\r 1.
