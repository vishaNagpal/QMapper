{"i": "59520", "t": "This site had been useful for my preparation. So, I wanted to post the questions that i faced today in Amazon phone interview. I'm listing the questions..\r 1) Given two arrays, how will you find out the common elements in both?\rMy Ans: Take every element from Array1 and iterate it over Array2 to find any match. If matched then print it as a common element. Else go for the second element in Array1 and so on until the end.\r 2) What is the complexity of the above algorithm?\rMy Ans: O(m x n) which is equivalent to O(n power 2) if m = n\r 3) Think of an efficient algorithm for the same problem (He gave me some time and wanted me to mail the code in any language)\rMy Ans: Create a map with the given Array1. Every element in Array1 will be a key in the map. And the values for the keys contain the number 1 (counter). Iterate Array2 and compare with the keys of map. If present, then increment the corresponding key's value.\rCommon elements are those that have their key's value > 1. (I assumed that the element occurs only once per array. No repetitions in one array).\r 4) What is the complexity of the above algorithm?\rMy Ans: O (n) - because we are iterating only one array", "k": ["ans", "amazon phone interview", "element", "common elements", "today in amazon"]}
