So he announced a sale on his plot. This drew attention of many land lords and everybody hurried to buy land at the cheapest prices. The king had declared that he would accept bids of only rectangular plots and one needs to mention the diagonally opposite corners(a, b) and (c, d) of the land he wishes to buy. They would write these 4 numbers (a, b, c, d) on a piece of paper, seal it in an airtight envelope and give it to the king.\r The king received N such envelopes. As the process was hidden there were many envelopes containing plot descriptions that shared some (or even all) common area. The king now wants to know the union of the areas of all plots that have come under the bidding.\r Note that the rectangles made by the plots are always aligned to the rectangular axes, their areas is always positive and c >= a and d >= b.\r Note that the rectangles made by the plots are always aligned to the rectangular axes, their areas is always positive and c >= a and d >= b.\r Constraints\r 1 \u2264 T \u2264 20\r 1 \u2264 N \u2264 20\r -10000 \u2264 a, b, c, d \u2264 10000\r Input\r The first line of the input contains the number of test cases T.
