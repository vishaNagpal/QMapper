Only those bits which are set to '1' would be used for checking while the rest be ignored. for example, a mask of {1000} would mean only 4th bit would be considered for checking while the filter won't care about the other bits of an element.\r\tID: It is the allowed value for the designed mask. for example, an ID of 1xxx (where x is don't care) with a mask of 1000 means that any element which has 4th bit as '1' would be allowed while if the 4th bit is '0', that element would be blocked. Since the mask doesn't check the 1st, 2nd and 3rd bit, any value, '1' or '0' would be allowed to be passed through the filter\r For the above example, a single mask of 1000 and ID of 1xxx solves the problem.
